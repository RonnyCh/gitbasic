Some useful function related to branching.

1. create a branch ---> git branch test
2. go to that branch ----> git checout test
3. make some amendments..... e.g delete a file.
4. commit ----> git commit -m "delete a file"
5. move to master branch ---> git checkout master
6. merge the branch to master ---> git merge test   (this will show a file has been deleted)
7. you can delete that branch tooo ---> git branch -d test
8. now you can push your master to github online ---> git push
9. your online will be the same with local now.
